# About the project
This is a work in progress project, as a team, we primarily don't know what we're doing. Our main goal is to reach the end of the project without irreparably corrupting the original binary file.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Do a brainstorming session to recall where we left of.
- [ ] Fix the Ditocco's and the neg*o's dialogs just before EVRE.
- [ ] Fix corrupted music.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
Given our passion for the open-source community, we appreciate any advice, but be warned, the game is quite cringy. 
We do not hold ourselves responsible for any deaths caused by the excessive amount of cringe.

Bella Reg√†.
